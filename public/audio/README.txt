# Audio Assets

Place ambient and interaction sound files in this directory. The application expects:

- `ambient.mp3` — looping background track (~60s) for default atmosphere.
- `ui-hover.mp3` — short hover accent (<0.4s).
- `ui-select.mp3` — confirmation click (<0.4s).
- `ui-teleport.mp3` — subtle swoosh (<0.6s) triggered during auto tour / manual teleports.

Encode clips at 192 kbps (or higher) to avoid artefacts and keep peaks under -3 dBFS.
