# The Exchange â€“ Project Overview

The Exchange is a unified platform for orchestrating enterprise data exchange and observability. It connects ingestion pipelines, governance workflows, and analytics so that product, engineering, and compliance teams share a single source of truth. Key pillars:

- **Multi-tenant ingestion** via API gateway and schema registry with lineage tagging.
- **Streaming intelligence** that monitors Kafka topics and data lake hydration in real-time.
- **AI-assisted governance** that surfaces anomalies, SOC2/ISMS controls, and carbon accounting insights.

This document tracks the vision, scope, and success criteria for the platform.
